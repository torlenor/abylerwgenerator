# AbyleRWGenerator

An Unreal Engine 4 plugin that takes point data in the form of an height map and uses https://github.com/KoderzUnreal/RuntimeMeshComponent to generate a world.

## Description

This plugin reads data generated with https://github.com/torlenor/qworldparser and uses https://github.com/KoderzUnreal/RuntimeMeshComponent to generate a world automatically.

It was some sort of proof of concept and I did never finish it, but it worked (believe me!). Maybe someone finds the code userful (even though it is a mess and really slow).
